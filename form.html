 <p class="text-center font-weight-bold">Now for a moment  lets think that I'm The Big Red Machine KANE !</p>
 
<p><br />I hope we all know the big 7 foot monster kane there's no need to introduce him specially no  more at this time 
he's one of the greatest WWE performers of all the time he was born in spain on 1967. <br /> <br />

He started his career on 1995 it's been a little long init ?  yes it definitely is a hell of a long career he's been through 
at first he was playing alone and this time he didnt wear any mask but later on, <br /><br />

 <b class="text-center">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 <br /><br /> 
 
 I guess it would be something like 1997 or something he was asked to play 
a little family so he was brought to a brother named The Undertaker together they were playing roles and that was the most strongest duo in WWE that time. <br /><br />

Then they were name "The brother of destruction"  later on they were given a father who sometimes used to take the side of The undertaker sometimes of Kane
one day The undertaker burnt his brother's face and dragged him to hell this is where tha story of a "Masked Kane" begins.
